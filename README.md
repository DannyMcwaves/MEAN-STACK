#MEAN STACK
**A simple mean stack boilerplate for creating scalable MEAN STACK web applications.**

**It contains a collection of packages that build a web application using `npm scripts`**

#FEATURES
- [x] **DEV : ** As the name suggests, it contains the files that are used for the development of the application. Mostly, files that will be minified, compressed or bundled for production. the production folder is the DIST
- [x] **DIST : ** The DIST folder contains processed files from the DEV folder. The files over here are ready for public deployment/distribution.
- [x] **DEPENDENCIES : **  contains enough third party dependencies needed to build a web app with express. You can take out existing or add new dependencies before installing the dependencies with npm
- [x] **DevDEPENDENCIES : ** contains enough third party build packages for a smooth and easy development process. It is not advisable to remove any of the DevDEPENDENCIES as current configuration might depend on it. But you can always add new one's to extend your development configurations.
